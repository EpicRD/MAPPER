## WHAT DOES MAPPER HELP US TO DO?
Mapper is a specialized all-terrain mapping program. Mapper helps users to map out mainly roads or slight terrains of cities or even countries (still on works). It then produces an image with the city roads on a black background (Background colour is adjustable depending on user).
Mapper might be helpful in creating for you an offline map when you go anywhere or help you to plan routes for travelling.

NOTE: The smaller the area you choose the faster MAPPER will render for you.

## HOW DOES MAPPER WORK?
Mapper gets a the user's city and the country to help locate the city on the map. Then with the help of OpenStreetMap APIs, Mapper extracts and processes data by adding colours to create an image of the map for the user.
